However, the process of conducting a comprehensive literature review is yet time-consuming. This paper proposes a novel framework, collaborative knowledge minigraph agents (CKMAs) 1 , to automate scholarly literature reviews. A novel promptbased algorithm, the knowledge minigraph construction agent (KMCA), is designed to identify relationships between information pieces from academic literature and automatically constructs knowledge minigraphs. By leveraging the capabilities of large language models on constructed knowledge minigraphs, the multiple path summarization agent (MPSA) efficiently organizes information pieces and relationships from different viewpoints to generate literature review paragraphs. We evaluate CKMAs on three benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed techniques generate informative, complete, consistent, and insightful summaries for different research problems, promoting the use of LLMs in more professional fields.

The results are presented in Fig. 3. We observe that CKMAs consistently outperforms vanilla GPT-3.5-turbo regardless of the number of referencing papers. As the number of reference papers increases, the performance gap between CKMAs and vanilla GPT-3.5-turbo widens. CKMAs demonstrates the capability to model complex relationships within long context, even achieving better results due to more references benefiting the understanding of the research, in contrast to the performance decrease observed in vanilla GPT3.5-turbo.

GPT 4.0 shows improvement but lists facts in parallel without logical connections. For example, citations 37 and 14 are listed side by side, but show no parallel logical relationship. It can even lead to hallucination problems, as no evidence shows citation 16 is a statistical method, while citation 16 and cita- tions 3, 6, 5 are all categorized as statistical methods. We then use different versions of the proposed CKMAs to generate a summary. It can be observed that without the knowledge minigraph construction agent (KMCA), the multiple path summarization agent (MPSA) contributes to highlighting different categories of algorithms from the desired viewpoint. Without MPSA, the KMCA contributes to organizing algorithms logically, e.g., from probabilistic to statistical approaches, and then to example-based learning methods. With both modules, CKMAs generates the best summary, categorizing algorithms as supervised learning as in the gold summary and detailing subcategories in a logical order. ",

While recent LLMs excel at natural language understanding and generation, they struggle to explicitly model complex relationships between ideas from multiple papers. To address this challenge, we propose collaborative knowledge minigraph agents (CKMAs). The contributions of this work are threefold: (1) We propose scientific document-oriented knowledge minigraphs and, for the first time, equip LLMs with knowledge minigraphs for multiple scientific document summarization. (2) We are the first to develop a promptbased iterative algorithm to process a vast amount of literature and automatically construct knowledge minigraphs for multiple scientific document summarization.
