Generated Result: The paper employs a method that divides text embeddings into real and imaginary parts within a complex space, computes the angle difference between these embeddings according to complex space division rules, and optimizes the normalized angle difference to enhance semantic similarity. This approach is tested on both short and long text datasets, showing superior performance in semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks compared to state-of-the-art models. An ablation study confirms the positive contribution of each component of the method.
