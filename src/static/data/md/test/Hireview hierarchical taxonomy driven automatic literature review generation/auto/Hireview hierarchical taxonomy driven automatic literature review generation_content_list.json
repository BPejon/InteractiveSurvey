With the exponential growth of academic documents, manual literature reviews have become increasingly laborintensive and time-consuming, while traditional summarization models struggle to generate comprehensive document reviews effectively. Large language models (LLMs), with their powerful text processing capabilities, offer a potential solution; however, research on incorporating LLMs for automatic document generation remains limited. To address key challenges in large-scale automatic literature review generation (LRG), we propose a two-stage taxonomythen-generation approach that combines graph-based hierarchical clustering with retrieval-augmented LLMs. First, we retrieve the most relevant sub-community within the citation network, then generate a hierarchical taxonomy tree by clustering papers based on both textual content and citation relationships. In the second stage, an LLM generates coherent and contextually accurate summaries for clusters or topics at each hierarchical level, ensuring comprehensive coverage and logical organization of the literature. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HiReview significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior hierarchical organization, content relevance, and factual accuracy in automatic literature review generation tasks.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been applied to this task due to their ability to manage long-range dependencies and provide richer contextual understanding. However, directly employing LLMs in academic writing can lead to issues such as hallucinations—where the generated content is not grounded in factual data—and may fail to accurately reflect state-of-the-art research ( Huang et al. ,  2023 ;  Tonmoy et al. , 2024 ). To mitigate these issues, some LLM-based approaches have integrated retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enhance content quality ( Fan et al. ,  2024 ;  Gao et al. ,  2023b ). In LRG, tools like Paper Digest 1   can generate brief summaries but lack the depth and comprehensiveness required for detailed literature reviews. AutoSurvey ( Wang et al. ,  2024 ) addresses the scalability challenges of traditional review methods by employing a specialized LLM in a multi-stage process that includes retrieval, chapter drafting, and refinement. Similarly,  Wu et al.  introduced an LLM-based method for automated review generation, consisting of four key components: literature retrieval, outline formulation, knowledge extraction, and review composition. However, these LLM-based approaches overlook critical prior knowledge, such as citation relationships, which are essential for retrieving relevant papers and producing coherent, accurate literature reviews. Additionally, they fail to organize papers into meaningful structures before the generation phase, limiting the system’s ability to fully comprehend the relationships between papers. These models rely too heavily on LLMs, with the generation process being primarily driven by prompts, resulting in less robust and often inconsistent outcomes. ",

By dynamically retrieving relevant information from a large corpus during the generation process, RAG models improve the accuracy and relevance of outputs in applications such as citation-aware generation ( Gao et al. ,  2023a ;  Menick et al. ,  2022 ), text evaluation ( Xie et al. ,  2024 ;  Yue et al. ,  2023 ), and open-domain question answering ( Izacard & Grave ,  2020 ;  Karpukhin et al. ,  2020 ;  Zhu et al. ,  2021 ).

In contrast, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) focuses on enhancing model performance in specific domains without updating all model parameters ( Ding et al. ,  2023 ;  Han et al. ,  2024 ). Key techniques in PEFT include Adapters, LowRank Adaptation (LoRA) ( Hu et al. ,  2021 ), and Prompt Tuning. Adapters are small neural networks inserted into the layers of a pre-trained model to modify its behavior for specific tasks ( Houlsby et al. ,  2019 ;  Pfeiffer et al. ,  2020 ). Instead of updating the entire model, only the adapter parameters are updated, making the process computationally efficient. Adapters have also been explored in applying PEFT to graph-based language models ( Chai et al. ,  2023 ;  Liu et al. ,  2024 ;  Perozzi et al. , 2024 ). LoRA introduces low-rank matrices into transformer layers, enabling fine-tuning of only a small subset of the model’s parameters while preserving overall performance. Prompt Tuning involves learning task-specific prompts that guide the model to perform various tasks without altering its underlying parameters ( Lester et al. ,  2021 ;  Li & Liang ,  2021 ;  Liu et al. ,  2023 ).

To assess the impact of using neighbor information, we applied two retrieval strategies for both models: one incorporating neighbor information as described in  Section 4.1  ( Retrieval w/ Neighbor ) and the other excluding neighbor information ( Retrieval w/o Neighbor ). Given a topic (specifically, the title of a review paper), we retrieved papers related to this topic from the citation network and measured the accuracy by calculating how many of the retrieved papers appeared in the references of the corresponding literature review.

For example, in the  1-hop merged  case, SentenceBert achieves an accuracy of 0.5234, significantly higher than BM25’s 0.3308. However, both methods show relatively low accuracy without neighbor information, and their performance declines as the size of citation networks increases, indicating that retrieving relevant papers becomes more challenging as the network expands. In contrast, BM25 significantly outperforms SentenceBert when neighbor information is utilized. For instance, in the  1-hop merged  case, BM25 reaches an accuracy of 0.7445, while SentenceBert’s accuracy drops sharply to 0.2602. BM25 maintains much higher accuracy across all scales with neighbor information. BM25, as a sparse retrieval model, relies on exact term matches, which is particularly advantageous in structured environments like citation networks, where specific terms (e.g., paper titles or keywords) are highly relevant. The inclusion of neighbor information allows BM25 to better capture relationships between papers by focusing on direct term matches in titles or citations. When neighbor information is introduced, the context around the target paper becomes more critical. BM25 effectively leverages this by prioritizing exact matches from neighboring papers, while SentenceBert, which focuses on semantic similarity, may lose precision when handling a broader context that includes less directly related papers.

Retrieving fewer papers risks missing important content, while retrieving too many introduces noise from irrelevant papers. Graph-aware retrieval significantly alleviates this issue. The graph context-aware retrieval strategy we propose achieves more accurate results with fewer retrievals, i.e., 200, reducing irrelevant information and contributing to the superior generation performance of our model. Moreover, even when applied to large citation networks (such as  2-hop merged  each containing over 200,000 papers), our method maintains stable retrieval accuracy, demonstrating HiReview’s robustness across different citation network sizes. Additionally, we experimented with different retrieval strategies, such as retrieving based on both the title and abstract.

The techniques employed in continual text classification can be broadly categorized into several approaches, including distillation-based methods, replay-based methods, regularization-based methods, and architecture-based methods.
