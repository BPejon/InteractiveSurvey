This includes automating key tasks such as systematically searching for relevant studies, screening and selecting pertinent studies, extracting data, and analyzing and synthesizing findings. By combining the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with real-time information retrieval, RAG ensures that responses are grounded in dynamically updated and accurate content, thereby addressing the limitations of static knowledge in traditional LLMs.\nThe methods mentioned in the paper for automating literature reviews using NLP techniques and LLM-based retrieval include the frequency-based approach using spaCy, the transformer-based approach using the T5 model trained on the SciTLDR dataset, and the LLM-based approach using GPT-3.5-turbo. These methods were evaluated using ROUGE scores, with the LLM-based approach outperforming the others.\nThe methods mentioned in the context include the Adaptive-RAG framework, which dynamically selects the most suitable retrieval strategy for question answering based on query complexity, and DyLAN, a dynamic framework that selects and organizes LLM agents for tasks such as reasoning and code generation using an inference-time selection mechanism and an agent team optimization algorithm. These methods aim to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of AI tools in academic research.\n\n\nCluster 1: Human-Guided and Clustering-Enhanced LLMs for Literature Surveys\nDescriptions for entities in this cluster:\nThe method mentioned in this paper discusses the use of a clustering approach combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and large language models (LLMs) to effectively generate AI-driven literature surveys. This method involves structuring the generation process through carefully designed prompts and utilizing an LLM API with specific configurations to balance creativity and precision. The clustering method helps in managing large sets of references and generating structured, coherent outlines, which are then integrated into a comprehensive literature survey. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through participation in the NLPCC 2024 shared task 6, achieving superior scores in metrics such as soft heading recall and ROUGE.\nThe method mentioned in this paper discusses an agent designed with human workflow guidance to generate literature summaries, enhancing the stability and quality of the summaries produced. This approach differs from the simple Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting method by integrating a structured human-like workflow, which guides the generation process more effectively, leading to higher-quality and more coherent summaries.\nThe method mentioned in this paper involves using a multi-LLM scoring mechanism to generate comprehensive survey outlines and content. This process begins with creating detailed outlines for various sections of the survey, which are then consolidated into a final, comprehensive outline. Each subsection is generated in parallel, guided by the outline, to accelerate the process. To address consistency issues, the method integrates a meta-evaluation step where human experts judge the quality of the generated surveys, ensuring alignment with human preferences.\n\n\nCluster 2: Domain-Specific and Citation-Driven LLMs\nDescriptions for entities in this cluster:\nThe method mentioned in this paper involves requiring large language models (LLMs) to provide citations to one or a few text passages for any statement they generate. This approach, referred to as ALCE (Automatic Long-Context Evaluation), ensures that LLMs generate text that is verifiable and faithful to the cited passages, thereby improving correctness and reducing hallucination. The system retrieves relevant passages from a large corpus, and the LLMs are prompted to cite these passages when generating responses to questions.\nThe method mentioned in this paper discusses utilizing domain-specific large language models to automate the process of research synthesis. This involves training these models on specialized datasets to enhance their ability to accurately summarize, analyze, and integrate findings from multiple research studies within a specific field.\n\n\n\n        The first level sections' hierarchy is given: [[1, '1 Abstract'], [1, '2 Introduction'], [1, '3 Dynamic Selection and Optimization of LLM Agents'], [level 2 and 3 sections to finish...]\n[1, '4 Human-Guided and Clustering-Enhanced LLMs for Literature Surveys'], [level 2 and 3 sections to finish...]\n[1, '5 Domain-Specific and Citation-Driven LLMs'], [level 2 and 3 sections to finish...], [1, '6 Future Directions'], [1, '7 Conclusion']].\n        You are required to finish the second and third level subsections under each cluster section with [2, 'a.b xxx'] and [3, 'a.b.c xxx'].\n        Notice that do not use the reference title directly as the level 3 subsection title, use comprehensive phrases to summarize the cluster with different aspects.\n        "
