        "text": "Abstract.  Automatically generating scientiﬁc literature surveys is a valuable task that can signiﬁcantly enhance research eﬃciency. However, the diverse and complex nature of information within a literature survey poses substantial challenges for generative models. In this paper, we design a series of prompts to systematically leverage large language models (LLMs), enabling the creation of comprehensive literature surveys through a step-by-step approach. Speciﬁcally, we design prompts to guide LLMs to sequentially generate the title, abstract, hierarchical headings, and the main content of the literature survey. We argue that this design enables the generation of the headings from a high-level perspective. During the content generation process, this design eﬀectively harnesses relevant information while minimizing costs by restricting the length of both input and output content in LLM queries. Our implementation with Qwen-long achieved third place in the NLPCC 2024  Scientiﬁc Literature Survey Generation  evaluation task, with an overall score only 0.03% lower than the second-place team. Additionally, our soft heading recall is 95.84%, the second best among the submissions. Thanks to the eﬃcient prompt design and the low cost of the Qwen-long API, our method reduces the expense for generating each literature survey to 0.1 RMB, enhancing the practical value of our method.

Firstly, these surveys are typically very lengthy, and even advanced models like GPT-4 [ 3 ] and Claude 3 [ 6 ] are constrained by a 4k-8k token output limit, making it impossible to generate a survey in a single pass. Attempting to generate the entire content sequentially based on all previous content can also be problematic, as it may cause the LLM to forget earlier information or fail to maintain a consistent structure without a comprehensive plan. Secondly, scientiﬁc literature surveys cover a vast amount of information. Transmitting this information to LLMs and generating a coherent survey can be very expensive in terms of LLM API usage, which diminishes its practical value. ",

As shown in Fig.  1 , given the subjects and several reference papers, we design a series of prompts that guide LLMs to sequentially generate the title, abstract, hierarchical headings, and the main content of a literature survey. By breaking down the task into manageable steps, LLMs can maintain a high-level perspective while generating headings, thereby improving the coherence and relevance of the generated surveys. Additionally, after generating the headings, the main content generation can be conditioned on this structure rather than on all previous content, signiﬁcantly reducing the cost of API usage. ",

Additionally, in cases where the reference list contains inappropriate content that Qwen-long refuses to process, we try to use references with odd or even indices to circumvent this issue.
